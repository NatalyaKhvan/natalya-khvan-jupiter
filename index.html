        <p>Hello, I'm Natalya! I’m passionate about technology and committed to creating high-quality software that truly makes a difference. My journey began in commercial banking, where I worked on loan processing systems and saw firsthand how effective software can streamline operations. This experience sparked my curiosity and led me into software testing, where I earned my certification as an SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test). Currently, I'm expanding my skill set by learning JavaScript at Code the Dream with the goal of growing as a software developer. I'm always eager to learn, take on new challenges, and contribute to meaningful projects. Thank you for visiting my portfolio—I look forward to connecting!</p>
